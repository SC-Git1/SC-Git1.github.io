        <h2 id="Data">3.1 Input data</h2>
        <p>In this workshop, we will run a SNP calling workflow on short read data produced on an Illumina GAIIx from exome-enriched DNA of chromosome 22 of a single human individual. The data was generated as part of the 1000 genomes Genomes project. The dataset consists of a subset of 1,151,702 reads with a length of 76 bps.
         The file contains paired-end reads, but most read 2 sequences are not included. However, it is advised to performed separate analyses on your forward and reverse reads. This can easily be done by specifying two files instead of one in the commands below.
         The data can be downloaded <a href="https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/VariantDet_BASIC/NA12878.GAIIx.exome_chr22.1E6reads.76bp.fastq" target="_blank">here</a>. The reference genome of chromosome 22 of version h38 (latest major human genome release) can be downloaded at the bottom of this page: <a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/" target="_blank">https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/</a>. Upload the files to the VSC, decompress the reference h38.fa by using the gunzip tool, and rename it to h38_22.fa to avoid confusion. </p>
        <h2 id="Create the Conda environment">3.2 Create the Conda environment</h2>
        <p>The following packages need to be installed: fastqc, bwa-mem2, samtools, bcftools, matplotlib, vt, and snpeff. First, create a new conda environment:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>conda create --name ws_snp_calling</span></code></pre>
          </div>
        </div> 
        Next, activate the environment: 
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>conda activate ws_snp_calling</span></code></pre>
          </div>
        </div> 
        Finally, install the required packages: 
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>conda install bioconda::fastqc bioconda::bwa-mem2 bioconda::samtools bioconda::bcftools conda-forge::matplotlib bioconda::vt bioconda::snpeff</span></code>
				</pre>
          </div>
        </div> 
        Alternatively, you can add the Conda environment by downloading the <a href="/workshop/3_SNP_Calling_from_fastq_to_vcf/ws_snp_calling.yml" download>ws_snp_calling.yml file</a> file, uploading it to the VSC and running: 
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>conda env create --name ws_snp_calling -f ws_snp_calling.yml</span></code></pre>
          </div>
        </div> 
        Don't forget to activate the Conda environment: 
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>conda activate ws_snp_calling.yml</span></code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        </p>
        <h2 id="FastQC">3.3 FastQC</h2>
        <p>In this paragraph we will run a QC analysis on the fastq file. The first step is to inspect the file content. This is important as incomplete data transfer can happen when downloading a file. In a first step, we inspect the head of the file:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>head NA12878.GAIIx.exome_chr22.1E6reads.76bp.fastq</span></code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <figure>
          <picture>

        </figure>
        <div class="caption">Output of head NA12878.GAIIx.exome_chr22.1E6reads.76bp.fastq</div> What does a file in the fastq format normally look like? Every read in a fastq file consists of 4 lines, also called 'fields'. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Field 1</strong>: begins with the "@" character and contains the sequnce id, optionally followed by a description
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Field 2</strong>: the nucleotide sequence
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Field 3</strong>: begins with the "+" character, optionally follwed by the content of Field 1
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Field 4</strong>: contains encoded quality values for each position in the nucleotide sequence
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Similarly, th tail of the fastq file should end with Field 4 of the last read i.e., end with a complete read.</p>
        <figure>
          <picture>
            <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" //assets/img/head_fastq-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/head_fastq-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/head_fastq-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp">

        </figure>
        <div class="caption">Output of tail NA12878.GAIIx.exome_chr22.1E6reads.76bp.fastq</div>
        <p>You can also check if the number of lines in the fastq file divided by 4 is equal to an integer.</p>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span># Number of reads, should output: 1151702</span>
<span>wc -l NA12878.GAIIx.exome_chr22.1E6reads.76bp.fastq | awk '{x=$1/4; print x}'</span>
<span># Or equivalently, check if the remainder is equal to zero</span>
<span>wc -l NA12878.GAIIx.exome_chr22.1E6reads.76bp.fastq | awk '{x=$1%4; print x}'</span></code>
																									</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>This list is not exhaustive. You can come up with additional checks for your fastq file. For example, you can check whether the sequence in Field 2 and the quality scores in Field 4 of the same length. When you share a file or upload it to a server like the VSC, you can also check if the files before and after transfer are identical by generating checksums with a program like md5sum. If there are issues with the fastq file, try to download it again, or contact the provider of the original file to report the issue. </p>
        <p> After you controlled the validity of the fastq file, you can run the program fastqc to check the quality of the reads. For this, first create an directory for the output data:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>mkdir -p fastqc_output</span></code></pre>
          </div>
        </div> and then run: <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>fastqc fastq_input_data/NA12878.GAIIx.exome_chr22.1E6reads.76bp.fastq -o fastqc_output</span></code>
				</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        </p> Have a look at the list of files written to the output folder: <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>ls -lah ./fastqc_output</span></code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>There should be two files in the output directory: a .zip file and a .html file. Download the .html file and open it in your browser. The .html file contains the FastQC report. The quality is measured by 10 statistics. The outcome is labeled in green (= pass), orange ("warning") or red ("error"). Images of the plots can be found in the .zip file, both in the PNG and SVG format. The FastQC report generated here contains 1 error and three warnings. However, note that a warning or an error does not necessarily mean that your data is of poor quality. Some statistics are expected to deviate based on the experiment you performed. It is therefore advised to always look up what the statistic means (within the context of your experiment) and the potential causes of the warning/error. In the next subparagraphs, we will go over all statistics and briefly explain how to interpret them.
         For more information we refer to the FastQC manual[TODO: REFERENCE!].
        </p>
        <h3>3.3.1 Basic statistics</h3>
        <figure>
          <picture>
            <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" //assets/img/stat1-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stat1-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stat1-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp">
            </source>
            <img src="/assets/img/stat1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();">
          </picture>
        </figure>
        <p>The basic statistics section never raises an error or warning, but informs you about some properties of the file:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Filename</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File type</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Encoding</strong>: guess of the data format used, indicates the type of quality score (Field 4).
          </li> 
          <blockquote class="block-warning"> <h5 id="warning">WARNING</h5> 
            <p>
               The reported encoding is only a guess made by FastQC and can thus be wrong. 
               This happens primarly when the quality of your reads is overall of very good quality.
               Therefore, always check if the encoding is what you expected, as this has a large influence on the plot.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The three possible quality score types are: Solexa+64, Phred+64 and Phred+33. 
            Some examples of data formats and their associated type are given in the table below.
          </p>
          <style>
            td,
            th {
              padding-top: 1%;
              padding-bottom: 1%;
              padding-left: 1%;
              padding-right: 1%;
            }

            td:nth-child(2) {
              text-align: justify;
              width: 60%;
            }

            td:nth-child(1) {
              width: 20%;
            }

            td:first-child,
            td:last-child {
              text-align: center;
            }
          </style>
          <table class="table" border=1px>
            <tr>
              <th>Encoding</th>
              <th>Quality score type</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Sanger / Illumina 1.8+</td>
              <td>Phred+33</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Sanger / Illumina 1.5</td>
              <td>Phred+64</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Sanger / Illumina 1.3</td>
              <td>Phred+64</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Solexa / Illumina</td>
              <td>Solexa+64</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>The type needs to be specified in tools like Trimmomatic (a read trimming tool for Illumina NGS data) and Bowtie2 (a reference alignment tool for short reads (50-100 bp)). Other tools only support one format, for example the reference algment tool "bwa-mem" only supports Phred+33 [reference:https://sourceforge.net/p/bio-bwa/mailman/bio-bwa-help/thread/CAF%2BL%2BTeKa9v0Nmjrn-DS9QKzsyTjAEcFyXMNkw-ygzLkdXo4AQ%40mail.gmail.com/#msg31652789]. Using Phred+64 files in a Phred+33 pipeline results in an incorrect interpretation of the quality score i.e., the quality is overestimated. Phred+33 is the standard in the newest Illumina versions, and the most widely supported format. To convert your fastq file to Phred+33, you can use for example the "FastQ Groomer" tool of Galaxy. </p>

        <p>The "per base sequence quality" plot is the most important analysis in the FastQC report. It shows the distribution of the quality score over all reads per position. The expected output 
            depends on the sequencing platform used. For example, in the case of sequencing-by-synthesis, the quality of calls degrade toward the end of the reads due to signal decay and phasing (= blurring of the signal due to loss of synchronicity within the clusters) towards the end of the run.
            The distribution of quality scores is represented by a whisker plot. The different aspects of the distribution and their visualisation are:
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Median</strong>: red line</li>
               <li><strong>Inter-quartile range (25-75%)</strong>: yellow box</li>
               <li><strong>10% threshold</strong>: lower whisker</li>
               <li><strong>90% threshold</strong>: upper whisker</li>
               <li><strong>Mean</strong>: blue line</li>
            </ul>
            The y-axis is split into 3 quality categories:
            <table class="table" border=1px>
               <tr>
                 <th>Quality</th>
                 <th>Color code</th>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                 <td>very good quality calls</td>
                 <td>green</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                 <td>reasonable quality calls</td>
                 <td>orange</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td>poor quality</td>

                </tr>
             </table>
        </p>
        The quality scores are calculated using the following formula:
        $$-10 \log_{10}(e)$$ 
        <p>
         Thus, high scores indicate higher sequence quality. The error rate and base call accuracy of some scores are listed in the table below.
         <table class="table" border=1px>
            <tr>

          Quality score above Q30 mean that virtually all of the reads will be perfect. 
          Q30 is considered a threshold for quality in next-generation sequencing (NGS).

        <h3>3.3.3 Per tile sequence quality</h3>
        <p>The "per tile sequence quality" plot only appears in the presence of an Illumina library and the original sequence identifiers 
         (which contain the flowcell tile for each read). This plot shows the deviation from the average quality for each combination of flowcell tile (y-axis) and position (x-axis).
         The colors range from blue (at or above average) to red (below average). A good plot is entirely blue.
         An error is raised if any tile has a mean Phred score more than below the mean for that position across all tiles.<br>

         The error raised here is thus due to the variability in quality scores in tile 115 for a few positions. However, overall there do not appear to be 
         major problems with the calls made in tile 115. Note that FastQC's thresholds for raising warnings or errors are not absolute indicators of good or bad data. Instead, they are to help you identify potential quality issues.
         Therefore, we should interpret this error together with the other statistics.

        The "Per sequence quality scores" plot shows the distribution of the average quality per read. Based on the figure, most reads have a high Phred score and thus are of very good quality.
        A peak below 27 (0.2% error rate) raises a warning, and a peak below 20 (= 1% error rate) raises an error.
        Moreover, a small local maximum may be visible at a low scores, which indicates that a subset of the sequences are of overall low quality.
        Often, the reason for some sequences being poorly imaged is their location at the edge of the field of view and thus this concerns only a small % of the sequences. 
        It is advised to quickly investigate the sequences of low quality, to identify the cause.

        </figure>
        <p>
         The "per base sequence content" plot shows the % of the 4 bases T, C, A and G per position. 
         In a random library, each position should have a base frequency that approximates the overall frequency in the genome.
         Deviations are the result of introduced bias during library preparation (e.g., overrepresented sequences) or during sequencing. 
         Some library preparation procedures will always introduce a technical bias, usually at the beginning of the reads.
         For example, the hexamer priming step of RNA-seq library preparation or libraries that result from fragmentation using transposases (= tagmentation), have enriched bases in the first 10-12 positions.
         This is usually not a problem for downstream analysis.
         A warning is raised when the difference between A/T or G/C in any position exceeds 10%. Errors are raised when the difference exceeds 20%.

        <p>
         The plot "per sequence GC content" usually contains a normal distribution with a mean equal to the GC content of the studied organism.
         The blue line represents the expected distribution based on the mean GC content. THe red line represents the actual distribution in the fastq file. Shifts of the normal distribution to the side due to systematic bias are not detected, since the program does not know the expected GC%.
         Sharp peaks on top of the normal distribution are an indication of contamination of overrepresentation sequences or a highly over-expressed gene. 
         A broad peak may indicate contamination with another organism.
         A warning/error is raised if the sum of the deviations from the normal distribution represents more than 15%/30% of the reads.
         If the total deviations from the standard distribution make up more than 15% or 30% of the reads, a warning or error are raised respectively.

        <p>
         The "per base N content" plot shows the % of N per position. An N is assigned each time that the confidence is not high enough to call a base. Thus, high percentages indicate that the data is not of sufficient quality to assure valid base calls. 
         A warning is raised if any position has an N content of more than 5%.

         In our case, all sequences are of the same length. An error is raised if any sequence has a length equal to zero.
         A warning is raised when not all sequences are of the same length. 
         Based on the pipeline you used, the presence and degree of sequence variation are a metric of the quality of the base calls.
         For example, some pipelines remove poor quality base calls from the sequences.

        <p>
         The sequence duplication levels are determined for the first 200,000 reads. Any read over 75bp is truncated to 50bp, because only exact matches count. 
         Because the likelihood of a sequencing error increases with read length, this procedure may lead to an underestimation of the duplication levels for longer sequences.
         Note that the upwards trend at > 10 in the figure is due to the binning.

        <h3>3.3.10 Overrepresented sequences</h3>

         There are no overrepresented sequences in the data. Overrepresented sequences are defined as sequences of  at least 20 bp with an occurrence of more than 0.1%.
         These are often remaining vector or adaptor sequences. They may explain skewed results in the "per sequence GC content" plot.

         <h2 id="Mapping to the reference genome">3.4 Mapping to the reference genome</h2>
         <p>
            To call SNPs, the reads should first be mapped to the reference genome. In case you work with multiple conditions e.g., normal vs tumor samples, you should map all samples to the reference genome and compare the called SNPs to filter out the constitutional (germline) variants from the somatic (tumour) variants.
            Popular mapping tools are bwa-mem, bowtie2, and minimap2. Based on the literature, the tools perform similarly.
            In this workshop, we will use bwa-mem2, a speed optimized version of bwa-mem.
         </p>
         <p>
            First, create an index of the reference genome. An index makes looking up a seqeunce in the reference more efficient/faster.
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">

               </div>
            </div>
            Then, align the reads and store the output in a SAM (= sequence aligment map) file:
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
               <div class="highlight">

               </div>
            </div>
            Sort the aligments based on their leftmost coordinates. By default, the output is is in the BAM (= binary aligment map) format. A bam file is the compressed (binary) representation of the sorted SAM file. 
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">

               </div>
            </div>
            Finally, index the BAM file for faster data retrieval:
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
               <div class="highlight">

               </div>
            </div>
            Have a look at the all the files that were created. Note the compression achieved with the BAM format (62M instead of 276M).
            The command samtools view can be used to display the content of the BAM file in a human-readable format.
            You can at this point delete the sam file to create free space in your file system.

         <p>Header lines start with "@". The first line in the header starts with @HD, followed by the version of the SAM/BAM format and the sort order (here: based on coordinates). An alternative SO value is "queryname".
            The second line contains information about the reference sequence i.e., the sequence name (SN) and the length (LN).
            The third and fourth line define the programs (PG) run to generate the file:

               <li><strong>QNAME</strong>: name of the query sequence, <em>61CC3AAXX100125:7:88:7051:20873</em></li>
               <li><strong>FLAG</strong>: representation of a 10-bit long sequence encoding the read's characteristics. For example, <em>16</em> stands for mapped on the reverse strand</li>

            <ul>
               <li><strong>NM</strong>: number of differences (mismatches/indels) between the sequence and the reference. Matches are only counted for A, C, G and T bases. "=" is always counted. Here, the value <em>0</em> means that there are no differences.</li>
               <li><strong>MD</strong>: <em>0</em> encoding of the mismatch and deleted bases in reference, <em>76</em> means a run of 76 reference bases are identical to the corresponding SEQ bases</li>

               <li><strong>XS</strong>: secondary aligmnent score,<em>76</em> means there is a secondary alignment with an alignment score of 76. This is consistent with the MPAQ value of 0</li>
            </ul>
            Note that the "i" in the NM, AS and XS fields means that the value is an integer. The "Z" in the MD fields indicates a string value.

            samtools idxstats reports alignment summary statistics i.e., (1) reference sequence name, (2) reference sequence length, (3) number of mapped read-segments, and (4) number of unmapped read-segments.
            Based on the reference aligment tool, the unmapped read-segments may be assigned to the reference sequence of their mate. 
            <details><summary>Optional: Unmapped reads visualisation and fq file generation</summary>
               To store the unmapped reads in the BAM format, run:
               <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code><span>samtools view -b -f4 NA12878.bam > not_mapped.bam</span></code></pre>
                  </div>
               </div>
               You can convert the unmapped alignments to a fastq file with samtools fastq in the following way:
               <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code><span>samtools view -f4 NA12878.bam | samtools fastq > not_mapped.fq</span></code></pre>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </details>
            In this example, there is only one reference sequence "chr22" with a length of 50,818,468 bases. The BAM file contains 1,136,643 read mappings to chr22. 
            Note that reads with secondary (multiple mappings e.g., repeats) or supplementary mappings (chimeric alignments i.e., split alignments) are counted more than once.
         </p>
         <h3>3.5.4 samtools flagstat</h3>
         Samtools' flagstat counts the number of alignments for each FLAG type.
         <figure>
            <picture>
               <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" //assets/img/flagstat.webp 480w, /assets/img/flagstat-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/flagstat-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp">

            </picture>
         </figure>
         In this example, there are 1,136,643 succesful mappings to the reference genome. 1,136,571 are primary alignments, and 72 are supplementary alignments.
         As we saw before, the fastq file contains 1,151,702 records (i.e., primary or unique reads). The total treats the supplementary alignments as extra records.
         <h3>3.5.5 plot-bamstats</h3>
         <p>
            We can visualize the bam file content in some summarising plots. To do this, first generate the summary statistics of the BAM file and write them to a file
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
               <div class="highlight">
                 <pre class="highlight"><code><span>samtools stats NA12878.bam > bam_stats.txt</span></code></pre>
               </div>
            </div>
            Next, generate the plots and store them in the output directory "stats_bam_output". Note that to run this step, you need to additionally install the tool gnuplot into your environment.
            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
               <div class="highlight">
                 <pre class="highlight"><code><span>plot-bamstats -p stats_bam_output/ bam_stats.txt</span></code></pre>
               </div>
            </div>
         </p>
         <h4>Interpretation</h4>
         <p>
          The statistics of this output and FastQC overlap. Therefore, you can compare e.g. the GC-content before and after mapping.
          An interesting figure to look at is the coverage plot. This plot shows the distribution of the number of mapped bases (log-scaled) against the coverage. In our case, most mapped bases have a very low coverage, because the dataset is subset of a little over one million reads.
          Usually, for SNP calling, a coverage of ca. 30 is recommended.
        </p>         
         <figure>
            <picture>
               <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" //assets/img/coverage-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/coverage-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/coverage-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp">

            </picture>
         </figure>
         <h3>3.5.6 IGV</h3>
         <p>
          Finally, visualize the BAM file in IGV (= Integrative Genomics Viewer) using the app or in a web browser (<a href="https://igv.org/app/" target="_blank">https://igv.org/app/</a>).
          For this, download the files hg38_chr22.fa, hg38_chr22.fa.fai NA12878.bam, and NA12878.bai. 
          First, load the genome i.e., the reference and its index into IGV. Next, load the BAM file and its index as a track.
          In the browser, the screen should now look like this:
          <figure>
            <picture>
               <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" //assets/img/IGV_browser-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/IGV_browser-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/IGV_browser-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp">
               </source>
               <img src="/assets/img/IGV_browser.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();">
            </picture>
          </figure>
          Locations on the genome are defined by a string of the format reference_name:start_position-end_position. For example, chr22:1-50,818,468.
          You can navigate to a window on the reference by changing the coordinates of start and end. 
          You can sort the BAM file on the MAPQ value to find aligmnments with a high MAPQ value by running:
          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre class="highlight"><code><span>samtools view NA12878.bam | sort -k5 -g -r | head</span></code></pre>
            </div>
         </div>
        The sort -k5 -g -r command sorts the records in the BAM file numerically (-g) based on the value in column 5 (-k5) in descending order (-r).
        Make sure to add a command at the end so that not too much output is written to the screen. 
        You can for example pipe the output to the command head, which by default only writes the first 10 lines to stdout.
        As an exercise, have a look at the region chr22:45,319,942-45,331,852. Most reads in this region are of very high quality (MAPQ = 60). 
        However, around base pair 45,328,200 is a cluster of reads with MAPQ = 0. This means that there is another position in the reference that gives the same alignment score (AS).
        You could identify some of these regions in your file and try to find the cause. Possible causes are repetitive regions and duplicate genes.
        </p>

        <h2 id="SNP calling with bcftools">3.6 SNP calling with bcftools</h2>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>bcftools mpileup -Ou -f hg38_chr22.fa NA12878.bam \</span>
<span>bcftools call -mv -Ov -o raw_snps.vcf</span></code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The bcftools mpileup command generates a summary of the coverage of mapped reads on a reference sequence at a single base pair resolution.
          Concretely, The file contains for each genomic position the reference base, coverage, alternative bases and the genotype likelihoods given the observed data.
          The option -Ou specifies the format of the output to be uncompressed BCF (= the binary version of the Variant Call Format or VCF).
          The option -f declares the reference sequence file. Note that at this point in the workflow, you can specify the minimum mapping and/or base quality for the alignment or base to be included with the options -Q and -q.
          The output is piped into bcftools call. This program makes the actual variant calls based on the genotype likelihoods using a statistical model. The output is written to an uncompressed VCF file (-Ov). The output file (-o) is named named rw_snps.vcf.
          The option -mv tells the program to only output the variants. The option -m sets the caller to multi-allelic. This means that all alleles that reach the call criteria will be reported.
          Alternatively, you can set the caller to the consensus caller (-c).
        </p>
        <h2>3.7 Quality control of the VCF file</h2>
        <h3>3.7.1 Inspect the VCF file</h4>
        <p>
          For quality control you can again first inspect the header lines and the first and last records.
          An example of a record is:
          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre class="highlight"><code><span>chr22	50799245	.	C	T	4.30749	.	DP=12;VDB=0.14;SGB=-0.453602;RPBZ=-0.859338;MQBZ=0;MQSBZ=0;BQBZ=2.18692;SCBZ=0;MQ0F=0;AC=1;AN=2;DP4=1,9,0,2;MQ=60	GT:PL	0/1:37,0,169</span></code>
              </pre>
            </div>
         </div>
         The different columns are:
         <ol>
          <li><strong>CHROM</strong>: chromosome the variant was found on, <em>chr22</em></li>
          <li><strong>POS</strong>: 1-based reference position, <em>50799245</em></li>
          <li><strong>ID</strong>: identifier of the variant e.g. from dbSNP, the value "<em>.</em>" means no identifier is available</li>
          <li><strong>REF</strong>: the reference base, <em>C</em></li>
          <li><strong>ALT</strong>: alternative non-reference bases, <em>T</em></li>
          <li><strong>QUAL</strong>: phred-scaled quality score; probability that the ALT call is wrong (see formula at start of this module)<em>4.30749</em></li>
          <li><strong>FILTER</strong>: filters used in bcftools call, "<em>.</em>" indicates no filters were used</li>
          <li><strong>INFO</strong>: additional information</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h3>3.7.2 Visualization in IGV</h3>
      <p>
        Next, you can visualize a high-quality SNP in IGV. You can sort the VCF file based on descending quality score using:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>bcftools query -f '%CHROM %POS %REF %ALT %QUAL %FILTER %INFO %FORMAT\n' raw_snps.vcf | sort -k5 -g -r | head</span></code>
            </pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        The bcftools query command extracts fields specified with the -f option from the file. Next, the records are sorted numerically based on the 5th column (QUAL) in descending order.
        Only the first 10 lines are displayed with the head command.
        You can change the number of lines from the default by using the -n option of the head command.
      </p> 
      <p>
      Download and the raw_snps.vcf file from the VSC and load it as an additional track in IGV.
        Next look at some SNPs (you can just add the position after chr22, IGV will automatically generate a window):
        <ul>
          <li><strong>36261582</strong>: allele count = 2 (alternate homozygous), high quality mapping and SNP</li>
          <li><strong>36256885</strong>: low coverage, therefore a low quality SNP</li>
          <li><strong>36160775</strong>: allel count = 1 (heterozygous), high quality mapping and SNP</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
        You can filter the VCF file to only contain SNPs above a certain QUAL cutoff value by using:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code><span>bcftools filter -i "QUAL>30" raw_snps.vcf</span></code>
            </pre>
          </div>
        </div> 
        Note that a QUAL score higher than 30 is equal to a confidence of > 99.9%.
      </p>
